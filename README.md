# Project Overview

Welcome to the project! The primary objective here is to develop a robust, Clean Code, and highly adaptable .NET REST API project with an Angular frontend. Drawing from years of experience collaborating with talented engineers, I want this project to embody my personal philosophy of software engineering.

## Project Scope

At its current stage, the project lays the foundation with a CQRS-like code structure. The overarching vision for this endeavor includes:

- **Clean Architecture**: The project already reflects this principle, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Domain Events**: As the project evolves, DDD with Domain Events will be a central focus, enhancing the domain modeling capabilities.

- **Authentication Policies/Roles Template**: Providing a template for defining authentication policies and roles to secure your application effectively.

- **Real CQRS with Command/Query Separation**: Aiming to implement a true Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern with the aid of a versatile query builder.

- **Identity Provider Integration**: Exploring the possibility of adding a layer of abstraction to seamlessly integrate various identity providers, such as KeyCloak, Azure B2C, and more.

## Ease of Deployment

To ensure user-friendliness and quick setup, I am contemplating the creation of a Docker Compose file that will enable you to get started with minimal configuration. The goal is to have the project up and running smoothly right out of the box.

## Project Status

Please note that I work on this project during my free time and as my schedule permits. Therefore, the frequency of commits may vary. However, I welcome your suggestions and feedback.
