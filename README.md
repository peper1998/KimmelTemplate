# Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to create a great Clean Code and ready to adapt to any requirements template of the .Net REST API project with Angular frontend.

For now I have just initiated the project and added base CQRS-like code structure. I would like this project to adapt things like:
- Clean Architecture - I think that it is impemented right now
- DDD with Domain Events
- Real CQRS with Command/Query context segregation using query builder.
- Maybe some cool abstraction letting developers to plug-in any identity provider(KeyCloak/Azure B2C etc.)
  
And to be:

- Easy deployable - i'm thinking about creating docker-compose file that will work out-of-the box with only a little configuration.
  

I'm working on this project in my free time and when I'm in the mood so don't expect frequent commits but if you have any suggestions, please contact me :)

Feel free to use this template in your projects or treat is as inspiration if you find it interesting.
